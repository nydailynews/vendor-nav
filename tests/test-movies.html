  <div class='rimage_text'><a class='revtitlelink' href='movie.aspx?review=1&movie_id=178980'>Ice Age: Collision Course</a><br>
   Ice Age: Collision Course, the fifth installment in this lamentably long-lived animated franchise, is the last Ice Age movie I intend to see. In a way, this review is superfluous. That's because Ice Age: Collision Course isn't a movie. Oh, it's projected on multiplex screens but it is, at best, an oversized, overbudgeted Saturday morning cartoon.<BR> <BR>Younger kids will have fun with the movie. It's in their wheelhouse. The juvenile jokes will amuse them and the braindead storyline won't confuse them or hinder their ability to enjoy the subpar 3-D and cheapish animation. Adults - well, that's another story. Admittedly, this isn't made for people over the age of about 10. But most children need adult accompaniment to attend a movie and, in this case, the sacrificial lamb can add another thing to the list of "things I sacrificed to have kids." I found the experience nearly unendurable and was fighting the urge to take a nap.<BR> <BR>Finding Dory is still in theaters. So is The Secret Lives of Pets. Both have their flaws but they are real movies. Compared to them, Ice Age: Collision Course is an embarrassment. It's a cash grab of the most crass kind, using the lure of familiar characters and a marketable name to fill 20th Century Fox's coffers. The movie's story doesn't try to make sense because, well, what's the point? We're so deep in cartoonland here that all but the most rudimentary aspects of the narrative have been jettisoned. This is about wisecracking, anthropomorphic animals and disaster film clichÃ©s. <BR> <BR>Everyone is back, which isn't necessarily a good thing. The main Ice Age trio of Manny the Mammoth (voice of Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego the Sabertooth Tiger (Denis Leary) were never that exciting to begin with and familiarity had not made the heart grow fonder. They are rejoined by Manny's family - wife Ellie (Queen Latifa), grown-up daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), and soon-to-be-son-in-law Julian (Adam Devine); Deigo's wife, Shira (Jennifer Lopez); and Sid's granny (Wanda Sykes). Simon Pegg's Buck is also back, meaning that, aside from Julian, the only newcomers in chapter five are lesser figures like Neil deBuck Weasel (Neil deGrasse Tyson), Shangri Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), and Brooke a.k.a. Sid's overdue love interest (Jessie J). <BR> <BR>Also returning, of course, is Scrat the Sabertooth Squirrel. This Wiley Coyote-inspired creature with bug eyes and a desperate love for acorns has been one of the high points of the Ice Age saga. Scrat's segments, disconnected vignettes reminiscent of the old Looney Tunes shorts, have not only offered amusing interludes from the more staid activities of the speaking characters but have featured heavily in the marketing campaigns. This time, however, even Scrat is showing signs of becoming stale. In Collision Course, he's chasing an acorn in outer space and on a space ship and the level of inventiveness and manic energy associated with his past exploits is missing.<BR> <BR>After having faced global warming, dinosaurs, and continental drift, this time the prehistoric mammals are pitted against an extinction event asteroid. Determined to do to our furry friends what something similar did to the dinosaurs (at least those not enjoying life in their underground hidden world), this chunk of galactic debris is headed for Earth, forcing Peaches to postpone her wedding plans and Ellie to stop sniping at Manny for forgetting their anniversary. If a way can't be found to divert the asteroid (where's Bruce Willis when you need him?), there won't be a sixth Ice Age film. (Go, asteroid, go!) <BR> <BR>Although the trajectory of the Ice Age films hasn't been consistently downward, Collision Course is the worst of the batch. With all due respect to co-directors Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu (both of whom worked on earlier Ice Age films), this one feels not only obligatory but lazy. I understand that in today's movie-making economy, lucrative productions must always have sequels. But there's nothing that says the sequels have to be flat, lifeless, and creatively bankrupt. Disney and Dreamworks consistently churn out product that's as enjoyable for someone age 40 as it is for someone age 4. No one will ever mistake Ice Age: Collision Course for one of those movies.<BR> <BR>Â© 2016 James Berardinelli

  <div class='rimage_text'><a class='revtitlelink' href='movie.aspx?review=1&movie_id=220247'>Lights Out</a><br>
   Fear of the dark - few phobias are more common across the spectrum of modern society. Horror, in all its shapes, sizes, and forms, often works by exploiting this. It's an underpinning of vampire stories and almost all horror films save their goriest scenes for the night. By taking this to a literal extreme, Lights Out would seem to have uncovered a foolproof path to frightening audience members. Unfortunately, the film stumbles, offering too few legitimate scares and displaying an overreliance on traditional horror movie clichÃ©s. Is the PG-13 rating a problem? Possibly - it's tough to generate the level of psychological intensity necessary for true terror when constrained by a kid-friendly rating. Is it a deficiency in director David F. Sandberg's approach? Again, possibly, although he found success in the 2013 three-minute short upon which this feature length version is based. Or is it that the story isn't as compelling as the concept?<BR> <BR>The premise of Lights Out is something we all accept as children but lose sight of as we grow older: monsters only come out when it's dark. In this movie's realm, the rule applies concretely. As long as there's a light source, the demon/ghost/supernatural presence is constrained. But once the sun has set and the lights are out, it has free rein. In order to make this work, Sandberg must employ an army of contrivances to explain why lights are always going out, flashlights are failing, and candle flames are flickering. He also occasionally cheats. The creature can reside in a lighted area as long as it's in shadow. And, in true horror movie tradition, all the characters make inexplicably stupid decisions. <BR> <BR>Although the film boasts a few solid jump-scare "boo!" moments, it proves unable to sustain suspense over its relatively short 81 minutes. The camerawork is unremarkable (consider how James Wan used viewpoint in The Conjuring 2 to amplify tension) and the characters are thinly drawn. Lights Out also spends an inordinate amount of time providing a backstory for the creature and explaining its nature and purpose. All this exposition violates the key horror movie precept of "less is more." Unexplained monsters are always more frightening than ones that arrive with a resume. (Sandberg's muddled attempts to connect the monster's existence with the psychosis of a human character is less-than-satisfying and never seems to make much sense.) <BR> <BR>Lights Out starts as a conventional "child in danger" story. Elementary schooler Martin (Gabriel Bateman), who has recently lost his father (Billy Burke) in what we known to be a supernatural mauling, lives under the care of his deranged mother, Sophie (Maria Bello). Sophie is prone to erratic behavior, talking to herself, and engaging in congress with something unpleasant that hides in the shadows. Unable to sleep and fearing for his sanity, Martin approaches his grown-up sister, Rebecca (Teresa Palmer), for a place to stay. Eventually, Rebecca, Martin, and Rebecca's boyfriend, Bret (Alexander DiPersia), venture into Sophie's haunted house, which comes complete with unreliable lighting and a ghost with a bad attitude.<BR> <BR>For those who like scary movies, there are few things more viscerally satisfying than ghost tales that deliver. Those films aren't about a coherent narrative or an airtight story. Their goal, quite simply, is to freak viewers out. To do that, all they have to do is create sympathetic characters, put those characters in harm's way, and (most importantly) generate a suffocatingly ominous atmosphere, pregnant with tension and punctuated by moments of extreme terror. Although Lights Out does an adequate job with the characters, it fails to elevate its tone and style above those of any generic PG-13 horror movie. It's a shame to see a clever premise developed in such an underwhelming fashion but that's too often been the fate of horror concepts since Hollywood decided to tailor a lion's share of the genre for pre-teens and young teenagers. <BR> <BR>Â© 2016 James Berardinelli

  <div class='rimage_text'><a class='revtitlelink' href='movie.aspx?review=1&movie_id=190819'>Star Trek Beyond</a><br>
   Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one. Although that description might sound self-evident, there was concern within the Star Trek fan base that the selection of Justin "Fast and Furious" Lin might move Beyond too far from its roots. Without a doubt, Lin has changed things - the movie's look is radically different, with an abundant use of shaky-cam shots and dizzying quick edits. The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn't unexpected; it's Lin's trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it's also instantly forgettable. <BR> <BR>Comparing Beyond to past movies (there are 13 others out there), this one comes closest in approach to installments #5 (The Final Frontier) and #9 (Insurrection). Like Beyond, those films were reasonably self-contained, supersized TV episodes. They weren't "event" movies or parts of larger story arcs. They would have been well-received as made-for-TV movies, but didn't pass muster as major motion pictures. Despite action and visuals that are an order or magnitude better than either The Final Frontier or Insurrection, Beyond feels like a lesser effort. It's more "Spock's Brain" than "The City on the Edge of Forever." <BR> <BR>Lin's mandate, one assumes, was to continue J.J. Abrams' mission to make Star Trek mainstream. Although Abrams' Trek may have been influenced by Star Wars, Lin draws more from Guardians of the Galaxy. Pegg and Jung's screenplay, which amps up the humor considerably from the tonally glum Star Trek Into Darkness, is complicit in this. No previous Star Trek movie has boasted visual effects this special - the craft evident in creating the Yorktown Starbase takes the movie where no Trek movie has gone before. The devastating attack on the Enterprise is impressive, although the ship took almost as bad a bad pummeling in Star Trek Into Darkness. Its final fate echoes The Search for Spock and Generations, although without much of an emotional impact. This Enterprise has always felt more like a prop than a character. It hasn't been around long enough to win our affection.<BR> <BR>Pegg & Jung's script, which picks up three years into the five-year mission, seems designed more as a means for getting action and character vignettes on screen than providing viewers with a compelling narrative. It can be summed up succinctly as: Big Bad Guy with alien prosthetics destroys the Enterprise as step #1 in an attack against the Federation and it's up to Kirk & co. to stop him before he launches the final assault. Subplots involve Kirk (Chris Pine) wondering whether he wants to continue as a starship captain, Spock (Zachary Quinto) pondering going to new Vulcan and helping to repopulate the species, and McCoy (Karl Urban) providing comic relief. Unsurprisingly, Scotty (Pegg) has more screen time than in the previous movies, showing his miracle worker abilities and bonding with a black-and-white warrior woman alien, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella). Sulu (John Cho), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) are given more to do than in either 2009's Star Trek or its first follow-up but they're still mostly in the background. <BR> <BR>The Star Trek movies have a history of using strong actors as villains. The Wrath of Khan established the template with Ricardo Montalban. Christopher Plummer came on board for The Undiscovered Country. Malcolm McDowell, F. Murray Abraham, and Tom Hardy followed. Abrams used Eric Bana and Benedict Cumberbatch. Now Idris Elba has joined the Star Trek family. Unfortunately, buried under all the prosthetics, he might as well be some extra pulled off the street. This is an unforgivable underuse of talent. Krall is a weak villain with an underwhelming motivation. The build-up to revelations about his past, one of the movie's hooks, doesn't have a satisfying payoff. <BR> <BR>Members of the "new" crew, who have now been involved in the series for three movies over seven years, are still growing into their roles. The camaraderie in the Kirk/Spock/McCoy trio is more natural in Beyond than in either Star Trek or Into Darkness and, for the first time, Pegg doesn't seem horribly miscast as Scotty. Saldana's Uhura remains a beacon of class and strength but I'm not sold on either Cho or Yelchin. Long-time Trek fans can be excused if they still see these second-generation replacements as imposters. <BR> <BR>In an era when none other than J.J. Abrams (with The Force Awakens) showcased the enduring power of nostalgia, it's odd that no attempt was made to involve any of the surviving original Star Trek actors in this production. Perhaps the best moment in Beyond involves a short but moving tribute to the seven original actors. The strength of that moment (and the way the playing of the original theme continues to elevate the emotional pulse) hints at missed opportunities. Skyfall gave Bond fans a fitting 50th anniversary celebration; it's too bad that Beyond doesn't replicate the experience for Star Trek loyalists.<BR> <BR>Then again, the cinematic landscape has changed. Original fans are grandparents, many in their late 60s and 70s (not in their 30s as when The Motion Picture opened). Except in isolated pockets, the passion isn't there anymore. That, more than anything, is the reason why today's Star Trek has become plot-light and spectacle-heavy. Star Trek Beyond can stand toe-to-toe with any of 2016's big-budget blockbusters. When it comes to visual razzle-dazzle and directorial chicanery, it has nothing to be ashamed of. But, as is often the case, those things mask deficiencies in the story. Forgive me for wondering exactly where "beyond" is taking us and whether, ultimately, the trek will be worth it.<BR> <BR>Â© 2016 James Berardinelli

   Let me begin this review of the 2016 Ghostbusters remake by pretending there was no 1984 iteration. How enjoyable would the film be if it didn't have such enormous baggage, if it didn't emerge under the long shadow of a beloved predecessor? The answer to that hypothetical is disappointingly prosaic: this is a mediocre horror/comedy that deserves neither high praise nor disparagement. <BR> <BR>Ghostbusters is pretty much what you would expect from a collaboration between several ex-SNL comedians and the director of Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy. It's fitfully amusing, features decent chemistry among the leads, enjoys two richly comedic performances (from Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon), and is dragged down by an overreliance on special effects and some boring action scenes. Perhaps the thing that hurts Ghostbusters the most isn't the recasting of the leads but Paul Feig's decision to spend so much of his budget (and screen time) on battles between the Ghostbusters and their supernatural foes. Because there's too little humor and even less excitement in those scenes, they offer little more than eye candy and that stuff gets old fast.<BR> <BR>Did I laugh during the film? Yes. Chris Hemsworth is hilarious - not exactly what one would expect from an actor known for playing hunky roles like Thor and The Huntsman. Kate McKinnon has her moments; her weirdness is occasionally irritating but, more often than not, it adds a spark. (Oddly, the two "big" names, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, are almost understated.) The script isn't as clever as it could have been but it delivers enough laughs to make things palatable. <BR> <BR>For some reason, however, the filmmakers believe that we as viewers will be excited/astounded by the Ghostbuster-on-ghost action. But 2016 is long past the time when even the most impressive special effects can inspire awe. We expect them. As a result, the lovingly crafted sequences of ghost mayhem in New York City provoke no more than a shrug. And, when it comes to battles, we yawn. It's not as if we believe any of characters are in danger or that the world might actually end. So why spend so much time and money on the disaster film material? Because they can? Because it's expected in a summer blockbuster? It drags out the running length and distracts from those aspects of Ghostbusters that work.<BR> <BR>That brings us to the road-block likely to keep many potential viewers from enjoying anything this film has to offer. This is an unnecessary remake. It's not the first or last of those. They come along as frequently as falling nuts in the autumn. In this case, however, the filmmakers have (possibly inadvertently) desecrated what some consider to be sacred ground. For me, the 1984 film was nothing more than an enjoyable diversion but, for some of my generation, it's a seminal movie - a classic that should be approached with care and consideration. Neither of these qualities is evident in this treatment. No one set out to offend fans - in fact, many of the players involved in the original movie are back in one capacity or another. Ivan Reitman is the co-producer and Dan Aykroyd has an Executive Producer credit. Akyroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts make cameos (along with a bust of Harold Ramis and Ramis' son, Daniel). The movie tries hard to provide as many call-backs as possible, including homages to some of the original spirits and a nod to the Marshmallow Man. <BR> <BR>It's curious why the decision was to make Ghostbusters a "re-imagining" with all-new characters rather than a soft reboot with new characters coming in alongside (to eventually replace) the old ones. As we saw with The Force Awakens, that's the way to extend a franchise because it excites the fan base rather than alienating them. In a tone-deaf publicity move, certain members of the cast and crew rebutted this hostility by playing the "misogyny" card (and making disparaging remarks about nerds still living in their parents' basements). Although it's true that a minority of those lambasting the movie sight-unseen are offended by the gender change of the leads, most are angered for one simple reason: their Ghostbusters are nowhere to be found. The newcomers could have been all male or all marsupial and the reaction would have been as virulent. You'd think people in Hollywood would understand that the best way to inflate the box office isn't to insult a portion of the potential audience. It's such a head-scratchingly dumb move that it's hard to believe it happened.<BR> <BR>All of this unpleasantness could have been avoided with a more clever script. The leads could have still been McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon, and Leslie Jones, except now fans would have been able to enjoy the limited appearances of Aykroyd, Murray, and Hudson as "mentors" (and maybe participants in the final battle). No need to change much. So why wasn't it done this way? Who knows. Hindsight is 20/20 and maybe enough people will be interested in the concept of an all-female Ghostbusters quartet to put aside any reservations they may have.<BR> <BR>One last noteâ€¦ I agree that the new cover of the "Ghostbusters" theme song is an atrocity. However, its use in the movie is limited. The original "Ghostbusters" song has at least as much screen time, being utilized for both the opening and end credits. The movie has endeavored to placate both those who love Ray Parker Jr.'s (or, as some might argue, Huey Lewis') '80s version as well as those who prefer a "modernization."<BR> <BR>I wish I could say the resultant product was a home run that will make all the concerns invalid. It isn't. But it's not terrible and shouldn't be avoided just because it isn't a continuation of an old franchise. Reboots happen all the time and, compared to some, this one is relatively successful. The new Ghostbusters work well together. They have a strong rapport and exhibit no difficulty commanding the screen for about two hours. The movie is too long and not funny enough but that puts it in the same category as many recent comedies. <BR> <BR>My advice is that if you hate the idea of a Ghostbusters remake, don't see this. There's no reason to endure a movie you're predestined to dislike. If, however, you have no investment in the original, Ghostbusters will provide what most of this year's other summer movies have delivered: sporadic entertainment followed by a vaguely hollow feeling that it could have and should have been better.<BR> <BR>Â© 2016 James Berardinelli

  <div class='rimage_text'><a class='revtitlelink' href='movie.aspx?review=1&movie_id=229605'>The Infiltrator</a><br>
   The story told by The Infiltrator - an undercover cop begins to confuse his true identity with that of the "character" he plays - may be familiar but the film's tone is not. As directed by Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer), this movie introduces us to Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston), a Federal agent who takes on the persona of a money launderer in an attempt to bring down highly placed principals in the Medellin Drug Cartel. Although the events related in the film (which are based on those chronicled in Mazur's autobiography) transpire in South Florida during the 1980s, this isn't Miami Vice. In fact, the intent (perhaps intentional) is for the gritty, noir-tinged The Infiltrator to tilt in the opposite direction.<BR> <BR>Mazur isn't a conventional undercover operative. He's not suave, handsome, or young. He wears nice suits but he isn't flashy. He doesn't womanize because he's a loving husband and good family man. He also doesn't carry a gun or become involved in traditional movie action sequences. The Infiltrator is about the "money" aspect of the so-called War on Drugs. Mazur suggests to his boss, Bonnie Tischler (Amy Ryan), that perhaps the best way to stem the cocaine tide is to stall Pablo Escobar's money train, so he adopts the persona of a money launderer, meets low-level contacts via his partner, Emir Abreu (John Leguzamo), and starts working his way up the food chain. His ultimate target is Roberto Alcaino (Benjamin Bratt), one of Escobar's immediate underlings. His weapons are dollars not bullets but that doesn't lessen the tension. Mazur becomes entwined with people who have no compunctions about murder and there's never a moment when we aren't aware of his jeopardy. His bodyguard reminds him that if the truth comes out, the drug dealers will cut off his limbs, give him a shot of adrenaline to keep him conscious, remove his eyelids, and make him watch as they do unspeakable things to his family. <BR> <BR>Furman keeps a tight rein on the film's palpable, sometimes suffocating tension. It's one of The Infiltrator's assets. Another is the ensemble cast. Led by Bryan Cranston, who's getting plum movie roles now that his Breaking Bad commitments are over, the actors do fine jobs. In addition to Cranston's expectedly solid turn, we get John Leguizamo playing it straight (something he rarely seems to do, opting for "weird" and "quirky" in most of his roles), a low-key Benjamin Bratt, and an underused Diane Kruger.<BR> <BR>At a time when far too many movies run too long, The Infiltrator has the opposite problem - its 127-minute running time is too short to do justice to the complex storyline. It's hard to say how much might have ended up being cut but the result is disjointed and contains continuity issues (one involving a bloody mini-coffin that arrives by mail at an address the sender shouldn't know). Characters appear, vanish, then reappear at odd times for little apparent reason. The film seems like it was taken apart and reconstructed during the editing process and the final version is at times barely coherent, with too much connective tissue missing. I wonder if this might be another Kingdom of Heaven. The Ridley Scott epic was sliced and diced for theatrical distribution but the restored director's cut is a masterpiece. <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, pacing issues aside, The Infiltrator is compelling cinema. By eschewing shoot-outs, fights, and other "staple" action scenes, the film is better able to focus on the psychological impact of the situation to the main character. He has a family he loves and cares about but his compulsion to do his job (referred to by Abreu as "my drug of choice") makes no compromises. And, despite a halfhearted denial no one believes, he comes to feel for the people he is destined to betray. There's something unconventionally devastating about how all this plays out. <BR> <BR>This is a flawed motion picture but, for those who prize acting, slow-burn suspense, and narrative over the usual loud, empty summertime fare, here's an opportunity for a couple hours of entertainment.<BR> <BR>Â© 2016 James Berardinelli

  <div class='rimage_text'><a class='revtitlelink' href='movie.aspx?review=1&movie_id=202526'>Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates</a><br>
   Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates exemplifies what passes for "raunchy comedy" these days: plenty of vulgarity and profanity without many accompanying laughs. In trying to push the R-rated envelope, filmmakers have become so focused on being outrageous that they have lost sight of being funny. There's a skill to generating hilarity from nonstop profanity and the creative team of director Jake Szymanski and writers Andrew Jay Cohen & Brendan O'Brien don't have it. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is steeped in swearing but little of it contributes to the film's "comedy." Like much of what transpires during the course of this production, it's just crass. <BR> <BR>The story makes as much sense as any modern R-rated comedy's narrative - which is to say, not much. Dave (Zac Efron) and Mike Stangle (Adam Devine) are hell-raising brothers. They like to have a good time and sometimes their idea of a "good time" crosses a line into mayhem. More often than not, their antics turn family events into 911 calls. Their parents, Burt (Stephen Root), and Rosie (Stephanie Faracy), are determined to put an end to this. So, for the wedding of their daughter, Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard), they have decided to implement a new rule: for Dave and Mike to attend, they must bring dates. For reasons that are never clearly explained, the Strangles believe that female companionship will somehow curb Dave and Mike's destructive tendencies.<BR> <BR>Getting dates with "nice" girls is a problem for the boys so they turn to the Internet for help. Pretty soon, their ad - offering an all-expense paid trip to Hawaii - has gone viral and attracted the attention of a lot of women, most of whom are undesirable as traveling companions. Among the potential dates are Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza), women who are the exact opposite of what Dave and Mike are looking for. But they want to go to Hawaii, so they fake it. Their plan works and, once they end up on the shores of the 50th state, their true natures emerge.<BR> <BR>By design, comedies rarely feature strong narratives or believable character arcs. These movies have a single purpose: to infect viewers with paroxysms of laughter. It stands to reason that the more one laughs during a film, the less he or she will care about things like whether the protagonist has a compelling backstory or the ending is credible. When a production is unable to generate the level of humor necessary to keep the audience in stitches, the screenwriting deficiencies become apparent. In something like Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, the paucity of good jokes makes the film's journey 98 minutes of tedium. The comedy fails in large part because of laziness. There's nothing clever here. The filmmakers believe that broad, obvious gags, pratfalls, and profanity-laced tirades are inherently funny. They're not. Those things generate laughter when someone shapes, tweaks, or delivers them in such a way that they lose the predictable, generic quality that permeates nearly every moment of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. On those few occasions when this movie tickles the funny bone, it's because of something unexpected or seemingly spontaneous.<BR> <BR>Zac Efron is a good-looking man but he brings little in the way of screen presence to the movie. There's little to differentiate Dave from the character Efron played in the two Neighbors movies. Adam Devine has the unenviable role of playing the loud, socially awkward brother and his performance consists of overacting and making strange faces. Anna Kendrick, the Pitch Perfect princess, fails to convince us that she can be a bad girl. The only one who fits comfortably into her role is Aubrey Plaza, who is credible for about two-thirds of the proceedings until the script assassinates her character. <BR> <BR>There's nothing unique in the failure of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. The ability to make a good comedy has become a lost art and much of what we see is like this. The expectation is that we'll laugh because it's supposed to be funny not because it is funny. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates spends the entirety of its running length going through the motions.<BR> <BR>Â© 2016 James Berardinelli
